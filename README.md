A sampler plugin.

This plug-in allows the user to drag and select a portion of a loaded file and assign this portion into a bank.
The user can slice the sample into a number of portions, with each bank containing its own ADSR, panning and other FX.

The plug-in will include its own built in sequencer, allowing the user to reshuffle drum breaks or sample hit
songs easier and faster. The plugin will have its own master effects station with a selection of filters.

*Currently made to be used as a standalone plug-in*
